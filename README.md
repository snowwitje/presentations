#### Slides from MozFest 2015 Session:
#### [UX Design Challenge in Scientific Software](http://snowwitje.github.io/presentations/mozfest2015/#/)

```Session Abstract```: How do you balance design simplicity and usability with high complexity of data and user tasks native to scientific research? How do you approach UX design in innovative big data-driven projects where users may not know what they look for? Designers, UXers and curious minds, join us in discussion on challenges and approaches in UX design for science. Help with ideas on our medical device informatics project, and share your project where collective creativity can help.
